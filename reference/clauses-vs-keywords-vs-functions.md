# Clauses vs Keywords vs Functions in SQL

- **Keywords**: Reserved words that form the language syntax (e.g. SELECT, WHERE, JOIN).
- **Clauses**: Parts of a SQL statement that perform a task (e.g. WHERE clause, ORDER BY clause).
- **Functions**: Built-in operations you use inside clauses (e.g. COUNT(), AVG(), COALESCE()).
